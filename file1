SEO means making your website appear at the top of Google search results.

For example:
If someone searches "best shoes for running" on Google —
the websites at the top used SEO to get there.

✅ Why is SEO Important?
More Visitors – People usually click on the top results, so you get more visitors.

Free Traffic – You don’t have to pay Google to show your website if you use SEO.

Builds Trust – People trust websites that show up first.

Grow Your Business – More people visiting your site means more chances to sell your product or service.
