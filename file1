SEO means making your website appear at the top of Google search results.

For example:
If someone searches "best shoes for running" on Google —
the websites at the top used SEO to get there.

✅ Why is SEO Important?
More Visitors – People usually click on the top results, so you get more visitors.

Free Traffic – You don’t have to pay Google to show your website if you use SEO.

Builds Trust – People trust websites that show up first.

Grow Your Business – More people visiting your site means more chances to sell your product or service.

    👉 Example: If someone wants to buy shoes, they might search: "best running shoes for men".
    This entire phrase is a keyword.

    Intent behind keyword (also called search intent):
    This means why the person is searching for that keyword.

short tail vs long tail keyword


🔹 Short-Tail Keywords

    1 to 2 words

    Very broad and general

    High search volume

    High competition

    Harder to rank

✅ Example:

    “shoes”

    “laptop”

    “pizza”

🔸 Intent is not clear – You don't know exactly what the user wants.
🔹 Long-Tail Keywords

    3 or more words

    Very specific

    Low search volume (each)

    Low competition

    Easier to rank

    Higher conversion rate (because it matches user intent)

✅ Example:

    “best running shoes for flat feet”

    “buy budget laptop for students”

    “vegan pizza near me”

🔸 Intent is clear – You know exactly what the user is looking for.
📌 Summary:

Length	1–2 words	3+ words
Specificity	General	Very specific
Search Volume	High	Low to medium
